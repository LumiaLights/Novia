///                            layer opened above it.
/// @param closeOnEscape       If `true`, escape key presses will not be handled by the main [GuiScreen] instance but by
///                            this layer, the escape key will always be handled by the most recent modal layer with
///                            this flag enabled, if a modal is closed on escape all more recent modal layers will be
///                            closed first up to the modal affected by this flag. Any modal, which has this flag
///                            disabled, will pass the escape press through to the next modal layer until one can handle
///                            it; otherwise it will travel all the way up to the screen layer, which will then handle
///                            the escape press.

///                            this will also cause anything behind the layer to become unfocusable.
/// @param associatedComponent An associated component allows the modal to be positioned relative to that component;
///                            additionally, it will prompt to close the modal once it isn't part of the screen any more
///                            or when it becomes invisible. Any modal depending on another component will also get the
